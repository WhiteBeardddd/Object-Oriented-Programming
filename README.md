# Object-Oriented-Programming
---
## This repository is for my Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) class in the 1st Semester of 2025.

It will contain my codes developed throughout the course, including:

🖥️ Implementations of OOP principles (encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction)

🚀 Programming activities, assignments, and projects written in code form

📂 Organized source files that reflect my learning and application of OOP concepts

This repository serves as both a record of my coding journey in OOP and a showcase of my progress during 2025.
